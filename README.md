## Nelson Adhepeau — Security Researcher / Security Engineer

I work on early security risk analysis:
**supply-chain trust, update mechanisms, configuration assumptions** —
before scanning or exploitation.

### Current focus
- Supply-chain security & trust boundaries
- Linux & infrastructure security
- CMS & firewall update mechanisms
- Incident response & root cause analysis
